we stopped requesting this marker test in <number> for me. this was first time since then they put it back on my blood work.. <user> i finally got the ca <allcaps> <number><number> so i don‚Äôt have prior history with that. 
i would rather rely on scans to detect cancers. i feel that is more reliable. <hashtag> cancer. had my sister shave more of my hair today as it was still coming out a lot. she said she didn‚Äôt realize how many chemo rashes / sores i had on my scalp &amp; i said yes &amp; i tried to tell my onc team. so miserable &amp; itchy. now hopefully they can heal. <hashtag> cancer <hashtag> bcsm <hashtag> chemo <hashtag> hairloss <url>. good morning! happy sunday! hope y‚Äôall have a beautiful day. ‚òÄÔ∏èüíõüß°

i received a gift of ‚Äúknitted knockers‚Äù f / a guy i know on ig <allcaps> whose grandma makes them w / a group who donated them to cancer patients. i put it in my bra &amp; filled out shirts.. if surgery isn‚Äôt an option for you, i wasn‚Äôt a fan of foam inserts, but i was gifted knitted knockers in different sizes &amp; i put it in my bra &amp; it‚Äôs made w / yarn so it‚Äôs soft. at least it appeared like i had <number> breasts. <user> üôèüèª‚ù§Ô∏è

might as well pay off my medical debts.. this just came across my timeline and. <repeat>

damn <allcaps>.. <user> <user> <user> yup! that's what i thought!

i'll be finished with residency and knock-on-wood-cancer-free and we'll all be vaccinated and heck <allcaps> yeah <allcaps> it <allcaps>'s going <allcaps> to <allcaps> be <allcaps> a fun <allcaps> time <allcaps>.

so everyone: get your squishy d<number>s so we can play d<number> dodgeball.. <user> <user> as the immunocompromised cancer patient, not fully vaccinated person involved in this, i'm constantly terrified i'm going to be the one who dies.. breathing <allcaps>.

everyone who has ever had cancer breathed.

i finally figured it out.. <user> <user> we live together, so his ex's anti-mask stance has caused me a great deal of personal anxiety over the past year due to my cancer and lack of immune system. mortality rates for covid <allcaps> for cancer patients is as high as <number>%. but yes, that stance also endangers everyone <allcaps>, not just me.. <user> <user> yup.

sounds about right.

imagine what we could have done with all that moolah.

""hey you. got money? get cancer!"" <url>. <user> <user> <user> i'm totally in.

someone mentioned something about a vacation earlier on a cancer tweet and i truly cannot remember what actual vacation feels like. üòÇ. <user> they literally took all of my work and published it.

i'm just over here crying.

so i get cancer and <allcaps> i get screwed over.. <user> <user> i'm sorry for this. as so many others have said, the cancer diagnosis / subsequent saga really do illuminate some things in your life. sometimes that does mean finding out who can tolerate walking through the fire with you, and who just might not have that emotional ability.. if anyone is curious about what breast cancer surgery then daily rounds of radiation looks like: this <allcaps>.

she's at <number> rounds. i had <number> total.. <user> one of my aml <allcaps> patients told me, ""if i had known what the treatment would be like, i never would have done it."" that was a few years ago, before my own cancer treatment.

for me, i'm grateful for it, and glad for every single treatment. but going through it is so scary and tough.. <user> <user> this is the surgery i wound up deciding on. i'm wondering what information we have on risks of recurrence for an oncoplasty vs mastectomy vs lumpectomy. any thoughts? <hashtag> bcsm. mkay, y'all, category is face <allcaps>. i post a lot to normalize cancer for my carcinomies, so here goes again.

if you're comfortable sharing, please do. i know i love getting to know all of you better. you make my heart happy <hashtag>  t t r p g solidarity <hashtag> ttrpgfamily.

all these in the past <number>year. <url>. <user> others' enthusiasm and excitement and willingness to put together a party to jump in. one of my friends whom i lassoed into playing <number>e after my cancer diagnosis went on to try out motw as a player, and now she's really <allcaps> wanting to gm <allcaps> for the rest of us. that's infectious for me!. <user> as excellent as my medical care has been, at no point in the last <number> months has anyone once <allcaps> asked about my mental health, or offered any resources for psycho-oncology, sleep medicine, or non-pharmaceutical pain management.

why are these conversations not happening?

<hashtag> bcsm. <user> <user> <user> they told me i need to wait <number> months after radiation for scans, so that just feels like time stretching away before me, and what happens if the cancer comes back before that?

definitely a mental tug of war. and very isolating for me.. <user> <user> i'm sorry, julie. i understand the added burden of financial crisis to pay for cancer treatment (i'm in the same boat), but i can't imagine how much harder it is with unsupportive family. i had to set up my own fundraiser because i had no other option. we do what we need to do.. <user> i'm here! i'm only a few months ahead of you but i'm here! tnbc <allcaps> stage <number>b, grade <number> tumor size <number>. oh <allcaps> no <allcaps>.

so i got to the end, but. <repeat>apparently winning the game just landed me in ""anxiety central"" and this game really freaking sucks.

[<number> / x] <url>. p.s. after consultation with many breast cancer oncologists, i have decided to move ahead with <number> more months of chemo for my stage <number> triple negative breast cancer, in hopes that it will reduce my risk of recurrence.

so, i suppose, if it helps, then it's a good day indeed. üíö. <user> thank you, shima. it'll be another long haul, but anything i can do to reduce cancer risk is worth it.

and i'm so touched. the amount of support i've received lately has touched my heart.. <user> this gives my cancer-having, <hashtag>  dn d playing, doctor-being heart such a happy.. <user> yes! now i want to create an online <hashtag>  dn d group for cancer patients and doctors so we can all get our nerdery on!. y'know what, twitter? i really do not <allcaps> want to see promos about  tnbc  metastases to the brain or higher risks of recurrence. i hate that i just learned that tnbc <allcaps> cells have an innate ability to adapt to living in the brain.

now i'm having another anxiety attack. <hashtag>  fuck cancer. <user> ah <elong>, much better. much, much better. üíö

(guess what was literally right <allcaps> above <allcaps> this post? that's right. the tnbc <allcaps> promo again about decreased survival time.) <url>. <user> yup <allcaps>.

can't i get more ads for cheese? seriously people. i don't want cancer. i am not going to buy cancer.

but <allcaps> i will <allcaps> buy <allcaps> all <allcaps> of <allcaps> the <allcaps> cheese <allcaps>.. <user> <user> <user> i like to think i'm a fairly decent gobbo. i call all of my supporters and treatments through my cancer journey my goblin army.. <user> same here on the tnbc <allcaps>.. <user> that sounds like a good way to spend the day. cozy and relaxing. the opposite of cancer diagnosis.. <user> oh, this is wonderful.

i'm not a cat person and have only ever had my one guy, for the past <number> years now. he was thrown into the dumpster as a kitten with his litter mates in a garbage bag. i've had him since then, when he was so young, as he was the only survivor.. <user> a man found the bag, brought them to the animal shelter. he was the only survivor. i adopted him the day they put him up for adoption (after treatment, surgery, nutrition).

i didn't do anything to get cancer.

the entire situation is rigged.. <user> i appreciate your words. i'm fighting against the feelings of guilt that i didn't do or say enough. we live in ma <allcaps>, and she's back home in ca <allcaps>. with cancer and covid <allcaps>, i couldn't have visited, i know.. waiting to see my medical oncologist to get the ball rolling on starting <number> more months of chemo. blood pressure is through the roof from anxiety. <hashtag> bcsm

but i'm wearing my new <user> shirt to remind myself that today is <allcaps> a good day! <url>. so it's official!

as soon as my insurance approves it, i'll be starting <number> more months of chemo.

if it reduces the risk of the cancer recurring, it is a good day indeed. many thanks again to <user> for my courage-inspiring shirt!. <user> <user> thank you, my meggy. i've always enjoyed taking the scenic route, so that's a wonderful way to think about this. and if this helps keep the cancer away longer in my life, it's worth it. üíö. <user> <user> that's the best way to think about it ‚Äî it's about doing everything i can now so future me hopefully never has to deal with cancer again.

and thank you! i love my shirt, and my fuzzy potato ü•î hair is so funny.. <user> <user> you know how much i love the huge hulk hugs! (the ohana triple-h)

it'll be just the next part of this crazy cancer adventure ‚Äî it's a rollercoaster!. <user> <user> aw <elong>, thank you, hannah! i'm really digging my shirt, and tomorrow i'll wear my cancer superpowers shirt from <user>. need to remind myself that this is all worth it!. <user> <user> i feel so unbelievably fortunate for this. <number> years ago, when i was in my darkest days, i never would have thought i would be connected to such amazing people, even despite the cancer.

my heart is full. üíö. <user> <user> yes, it is a nasty cancer monster. and it deserves to die <allcaps>.

thank you! i'm going in swinging!. i don't think much about my physical appearance, because going through cancer treatment is incredibly ugly. truly, physically ugly.

so it just struck me that i can tell the difference between my mastectomy / recon side and the other side. <hashtag> bcsm <url>. <user> samesies. stupid cancer.. yew helped to save my life.
