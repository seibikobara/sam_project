my thoughts are that the cancer was incredibly rapid growing, with minimal response to standard of care ac <allcaps>-t. if there's the outside chance of triple negative (let alone real chance!), it seems erring on the side of xeloda would be advisable.

thoughts?. <user> may <number> i was told i likely had only <number> months left to live. my husband divorced me because he didn't want to watch me die. my disease worsened, had to drop out of residency <number> reapplied <number> started july <number> <number> diagnosed stage <number> cancer july <number>

for me, i'm grateful for it, and glad for every single treatment. but going through it is so scary and tough.. <user> <user> this is the surgery i wound up deciding on. i'm wondering what information we have on risks of recurrence for an oncoplasty vs mastectomy vs lumpectomy. any thoughts? <hashtag> bcsm. mkay, y'all, category is face <allcaps>. i post a lot to normalize cancer for my carcinomies, so here goes again.

all these in the past <number>year. <url>. <user> others' enthusiasm and excitement and willingness to put together a party to jump in. one of my friends whom i lassoed into playing <number>e after my cancer diagnosis went on to try out motw as a player, and now she's really <allcaps> wanting to gm <allcaps> for the rest of us. that's infectious for me!. <user> as excellent as my medical care has been, at no point in the last <number> months has anyone once <allcaps> asked about my mental health, or offered any resources for psycho-oncology, sleep medicine, or non-pharmaceutical pain management.

why are these conversations not happening?

<hashtag> bcsm. <user> <user> <user> they told me i need to wait <number> months after radiation for scans, so that just feels like time stretching away before me, and what happens if the cancer comes back before that?

definitely a mental tug of war. and very isolating for me.. <user> <user> i'm sorry, julie. i understand the added burden of financial crisis to pay for cancer treatment (i'm in the same boat), but i can't imagine how much harder it is with unsupportive family. i had to set up my own fundraiser because i had no other option. we do what we need to do.. <user> i'm here! i'm only a few months ahead of you but i'm here! tnbc <allcaps> stage <number>b, grade <number> tumor size <number>. oh <allcaps> no <allcaps>.

next, this super secret mission surprise from my beloved <user>.

you <allcaps> guys <allcaps>. can <allcaps> you <allcaps> even <allcaps>.

[<number> / x] <url>. p.s. after consultation with many breast cancer oncologists, i have decided to move ahead with <number> more months of chemo for my stage <number> triple negative breast cancer, in hopes that it will reduce my risk of recurrence.

so, i suppose, if it helps, then it's a good day indeed. 💚. <user> thank you, shima. it'll be another long haul, but anything i can do to reduce cancer risk is worth it.

and i'm so touched. the amount of support i've received lately has touched my heart.. <user> this gives my cancer-having, <hashtag>  dn d playing, doctor-being heart such a happy.. <user> yes! now i want to create an online <hashtag>  dn d group for cancer patients and doctors so we can all get our nerdery on!. y'know what, twitter? i really do not <allcaps> want to see promos about  tnbc  metastases to the brain or higher risks of recurrence. i hate that i just learned that tnbc <allcaps> cells have an innate ability to adapt to living in the brain.

now i'm having another anxiety attack. <hashtag>  fuck cancer. <user> ah <elong>, much better. much, much better. 💚

(guess what was literally right <allcaps> above <allcaps> this post? that's right. the tnbc <allcaps> promo again about decreased survival time.) <url>. <user> yup <allcaps>.

can't i get more ads for cheese? seriously people. i don't want cancer. i am not going to buy cancer.

but <allcaps> i will <allcaps> buy <allcaps> all <allcaps> of <allcaps> the <allcaps> cheese <allcaps>.. <user> <user> <user> i like to think i'm a fairly decent gobbo. i call all of my supporters and treatments through my cancer journey my goblin army.. <user> same here on the tnbc <allcaps>.. <user> that sounds like a good way to spend the day. cozy and relaxing. the opposite of cancer diagnosis.. <user> oh, this is wonderful.

i'm not a cat person and have only ever had my one guy, for the past <number> years now. he was thrown into the dumpster as a kitten with his litter mates in a garbage bag. i've had him since then, when he was so young, as he was the only survivor.. <user> a man found the bag, brought them to the animal shelter. he was the only survivor. i adopted him the day they put him up for adoption (after treatment, surgery, nutrition).

to him, i really am his mom. <url>. <user> <user> <user> <user> <user> each one of my lifesaving taxol chemo treatments was $<number>

i didn't do anything to get cancer.

the entire situation is rigged.. <user> i appreciate your words. i'm fighting against the feelings of guilt that i didn't do or say enough. we live in ma <allcaps>, and she's back home in ca <allcaps>. with cancer and covid <allcaps>, i couldn't have visited, i know.. waiting to see my medical oncologist to get the ball rolling on starting <number> more months of chemo. blood pressure is through the roof from anxiety. <hashtag> bcsm

but i'm wearing my new <user> shirt to remind myself that today is <allcaps> a good day! <url>. so it's official!

as soon as my insurance approves it, i'll be starting <number> more months of chemo.

if it reduces the risk of the cancer recurring, it is a good day indeed. many thanks again to <user> for my courage-inspiring shirt!. <user> <user> thank you, my meggy. i've always enjoyed taking the scenic route, so that's a wonderful way to think about this. and if this helps keep the cancer away longer in my life, it's worth it. 💚. <user> <user> that's the best way to think about it — it's about doing everything i can now so future me hopefully never has to deal with cancer again.

and thank you! i love my shirt, and my fuzzy potato 🥔 hair is so funny.. <user> <user> you know how much i love the huge hulk hugs! (the ohana triple-h)

it'll be just the next part of this crazy cancer adventure — it's a rollercoaster!. <user> <user> aw <elong>, thank you, hannah! i'm really digging my shirt, and tomorrow i'll wear my cancer superpowers shirt from <user>. need to remind myself that this is all worth it!. <user> <user> i feel so unbelievably fortunate for this. <number> years ago, when i was in my darkest days, i never would have thought i would be connected to such amazing people, even despite the cancer.

my heart is full. 💚. <user> <user> yes, it is a nasty cancer monster. and it deserves to die <allcaps>.

thank you! i'm going in swinging!. i don't think much about my physical appearance, because going through cancer treatment is incredibly ugly. truly, physically ugly.

so it just struck me that i can tell the difference between my mastectomy / recon side and the other side. <hashtag> bcsm <url>. <user> samesies. stupid cancer.. yew helped to save my life.

(but why did you have to give me neuropathy and bone pain! <repeat>). <user> a few folx who have been raising me up nonstop through my recent cancer adventure:

having gone through <number> months of chemo already, i'm far more apprehensive now of what the new chemo will be like. anxious to start it tomorrow. nervous about how the next <number> months will be, when i'm back working in the hospital.
